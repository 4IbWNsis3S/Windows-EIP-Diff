# Windows-EIP-Diff
This logs EIP, GlobalAlloc, LocalAlloc of a complete Windows process runtime only from the core PE/COFF address space, and produces an ASCII log to diff with.  It automates reverse-engineering of even bleeding-edge VM based protections used commercially, and typical nested xor obfusators and stream cyphers used in malware. It's also useful for mostly-automated emulator/loader dev.
